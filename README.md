# meme-bank

### What it does

Meme Bank is a small web application written in Javascript using the Meteor framework. It allows users to submit their favorite gifs in the form of gfycat or imgur links, for easy access in the future. It also features a user-submitted tagging system where users can search for gifs through their tags.

Meme bank is under development and prototyping!

### What's next

* Add link checking & verification for gfycat and imgur links
* Find a scalable way to display a large amount of gifs on the page
* Add tag searching
* Add user-specific bookmarks for easier access to their own curated set of gifs
* Eventually move off the meteor framework
